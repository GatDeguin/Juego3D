# Narrative Overview

This document summarizes the game's story structure based on the design document.

## Premise

The player controls a test subject trapped in a research facility where gravity experiments have gone awry. Using a prototype gravity device, the protagonist must navigate a series of test chambers to escape.

## Structure

1. **Introduction** – Tutorial levels introduce movement and gravity rotation.
2. **Experiment Floors** – Progressively challenging chambers require puzzle solving and platforming under shifting gravity.
3. **Escape Sequence** – Final levels combine earlier mechanics in a timed run to exit the facility.
4. **Resolution** – The player escapes to the surface, hinting at further adventures.

Each stage features minimal cutscene text delivered through terminal screens in the environment.
