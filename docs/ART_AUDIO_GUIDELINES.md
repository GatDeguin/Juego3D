# Art and Audio Guidelines

These guidelines capture the visual and sound direction specified in the design document.

## Visual Style

- **Low Poly Assets** – Environments and characters use simple geometry with minimal textures to maintain readability.
- **Color Palette** – Laboratory surfaces stay neutral gray while hazards use bright accent colors. Power-ups and interactive objects should stand out.
- **File Formats** – Prefer `.glb` or `.obj` for 3D models. Textures remain small (`512x512` or less) and use PNG.

## Audio

- **Effects** – Short clips for actions like jumping, rotating gravity and picking up items. Keep them under 2 seconds in length.
- **Music** – A looping background track for each level; aim for 30–60 seconds per loop.
- **File Naming** – Use `jump.wav`, `gravity.wav`, `pickup.wav` and `background.wav` placed in `assets/audio` as referenced in the project README.
- **Format** – 44.1 kHz stereo WAV or OGG files.

Following these standards ensures all assets integrate smoothly with the existing codebase.
