# Juego3D

This repository is an early experiment for a small 3D game implemented with **HTML5**, **JavaScript**, and **CSS**. The project explores gravity‑changing mechanics in a minimal web environment.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository and navigate into its directory.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser:
   - either double‑click the file, or
   - start a lightweight HTTP server (for example, `python3 -m http.server`) and visit `http://localhost:8000/index.html`.

## Project Goal

The core objective is to implement simple controls that allow the player to change gravity during gameplay. The mechanics will eventually let the player rotate or flip the world to solve platforming challenges.
